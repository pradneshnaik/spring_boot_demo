# Spring Boot Demo
This guide walks you through the process of creating a simple spring boot application.

# Starting with Spring Initializr
You can use this pre-initialized project and click Generate to download a ZIP file. This project is configured to fit the examples in this tutorial.

To manually initialize the project:

Navigate to https://start.spring.io. This service pulls in all the dependencies you need for an application and does most of the setup for you.
Choose either Gradle or Maven and the language you want to use. 
Click Dependencies and select Spring Web.
Click Generate.

Download the resulting ZIP file, which is an archive of a web application that is configured with your choices.

Note
If your IDE has the Spring Initializr integration, you can complete this process from your IDE.
